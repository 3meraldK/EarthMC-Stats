# EarthMC Stats
The most popular EarthMC Discord Bot is now open source!

### About
Currently, EMCS is capable of 

### History
In 2019, a Discord Bot was created by [LuciferianThomas](https://github.com/LuciferianThomas) for the very popular **EarthMC Live** news server, 
which would help offline players see town and nation info, as well as get queue updates and see the server status.

In early 2020 however, Towny data was no longer available and so the original and *only* bot at the time, ceased to function.<br>
To make things worse, notorious player '**Aceshooter**' had implemented a backdoor into **EarthMC Live** and subsequently leaked a mass amount of messages from servers where the bot had read permissions.

As a victim of this leak, LuciferianThomas left EarthMC midway through 2020, leaving the behind the tainted remnants of the EarthMC Live bot.

Here is where EarthMC Stats steps in!<br>
Popular player `Warriorrr` and soon to be prime minister of **Britain** on **Terra Nova** had brought this code to light and discussed it with other members of Britian, who soon came to the decision to reignite the bot, having it exclusive to their discord. <br>

In just a couple of weeks, councillor `Owen3H` from the town of **Glasgow** had found a way to rely on data from EarthMC's [Dynamic Map]() instead of Towny -
though the bot was still significantly broken, the backdoor was removed and a huge overhaul began to take place.

EarthMC Stats has kept growing in popularity ever since, hitting 1.5k servers in 2023!<br>
As of today, `Owen3H` is the sole maintainer of EarthMC Stats and a plethora of [other tools](https://github.com/EarthMC-Toolkit).

### Notes
- EarthMC Stats currently uses DiscordJS version `13.6.0`.
- CommonJS is still in use by EMCS, though migrating to ESM is planned!
- Duplicated code is slowly being phased out in favour of helper classes found in the `common` folder.
- This repo is meant for viewing and attribution, hosting it yourself will not work.
