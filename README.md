# EarthMC Stats
The most popular EarthMC Discord Bot is now open source!

### Notes
- EarthMC Stats currently uses DiscordJS version `13.6.0`.
- CommonJS is still in use by EMCS, though migrating to ESM is planned!
- Duplicated code is slowly being phased out in favour of helper classes found in the `common` folder.
- To reduce reads/writes, an in-memory cache is used alongside [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - please don't mess with this.
- This repo is meant for viewing and attribution, hosting it yourself will not work.
